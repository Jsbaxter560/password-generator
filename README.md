# password-generator
In this project, a developer is tasked to develop supplied code into a functioning 
password generator. The process requires receiving input from the user to ascertain
various criteria for said password. Window prompts and window confirms are utilized 
in ascertaining said input, while window prompts are utilized to inform user when
specified parameters are not fulfilled. Once all parameters are established, a 
funtion is employed to combine those parameters desired by the user to be included 
in the generated password. To randomize the password, a for loop is employed utilizing 
the math random and math floor methods to randomize and force any numerical return value
to be integers. The return value is then displayed in an alert window.
